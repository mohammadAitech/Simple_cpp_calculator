# Simple C++ Calculator

This project is a simple calculator implemented in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It takes input from the user and processes calculations based on the specified operator.

---

## Features

- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
- Handles invalid inputs like division by zero.
- Allows repeated calculations until the user exits.

---

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- Basic understanding of compiling and running C++ code.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file `calculator.cpp`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadAitech/Simple_cpp_calculator/
   ```
---

Usage Example

1. Start the program:
   ```
   Enter operand (+, -, *, /, %): +
   ```

2. Provide numbers for calculation:
   ```
   Enter first number (or '=' to exit): 5
   Enter second number: 3
   Result: 8
   ```

3. Exit the program:
   ```
   Enter first number (or '=' to exit): =
   Goodbye!
   ```

Code Overview

The program consists of the following components:

- **Arithmetic Functions:** Functions for each operation (`jam`, `menha`, `zarb`, `tagsim`, `bagimandeh`).
- **Error Handling:** Division and modulus operations check for zero to avoid runtime errors.
- **Main Function:** Handles user input, calls appropriate functions, and displays results.

---

Future Enhancements

- Add support for floating-point numbers.
- Implement additional operations (e.g., power, square root).
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI).
